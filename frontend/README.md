Feel free to ask if you want help integrating backend APIs or deploying online!
The complete frontend setup has been shared step by step including:

- React + TypeScript + Tailwind config & setup files
- Sidebar layout with react-router-dom navigation
- Pages for Your Work, Board (with drag-drop), Team Management, Calendar, and Reports (with charts)
- Key reusable UI components: Button, Card, Badge, Avatar, Marquee
- Usage instructions and README guidance

This provides a fully working, modular, and maintainable React frontend matching your Figma prototype and functional needs.

To get started, create your project folder, copy the files shared into corresponding paths, run `npm install`, and `npm run dev` to launch locally.

If you want to continue, I can assist with backend integration, API mocks, or deployment next.
